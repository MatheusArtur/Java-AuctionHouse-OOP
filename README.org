** Included Patterns
*** Extract Method
    Implemented in *Employee* Class, removing all code *redundancy*. It no longer has repeated code fragments.
    <hr>
*** Replace Data Value With Object
    Implemented in Employee, the right usage of 3 classes; *Syndie*, *Agenda* and *Payment* and it's attributes. It no longer requires a String (data value) to represent them.
