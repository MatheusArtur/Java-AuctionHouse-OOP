* Payroll OOP
** Included Patterns
*** Extract Method
    The implementation of the extract method provided a much cleaner *Employee* Class, removing all code *redundancy*. It no longer has repeated code fragments.
*** Replace Data Value With Object
    Implemented in Employee, the right usage of 3 classes; *Syndie*, *Agenda* and *Payment* and it's attributes. It no longer requires a String (data value) to represent them.
*** Extract Class
    The once atrocious "runPayroll" method used in the App class, has been extracted to a proper class and it's functionalities. The now [[./payroll/src/main/java/payroll/][Payroll package]].

    - Before (code smell)
